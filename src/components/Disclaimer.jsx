              Online Forex/CFDs are complex instruments and come with a high
              risk of losing money rapidly due to leverage. 84.62% of retail
              investor accounts lose money when trading Online Forex/CFDs. You
              should consider whether you understand how CFDs work and whether
              you can afford to take the high risk of losing money.
